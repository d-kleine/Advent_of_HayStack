# **Advent of Haystack**

This project highlights the capabilities of [Haystack](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack) in solving real-world problems through a set of ten unique challenges. Developed by [*deepset*](https://www.deepset.ai/), Haystack is a robust framework for building pipelines that integrate retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), metadata processing, and other advanced NLP techniques. The event takes place during December 2024, blending technical problem-solving with a festive theme.

## **Project Description**

This project is a series of ten challenges designed to explore and enhance skills in using the Haystack framework for building advanced pipelines. Each challenge presents a scenario requiring the design, implementation, and optimization of pipelines using Haystack's tools and capabilities. The tasks focus on leveraging components from HayStack to solve practical problems.

## **Challenges**

### **Project 1: Fetching Knowledge**
The first challenge involved building a pipeline capable of fetching content from URLs, processing it for relevance, and enabling a seamless Q&A system. The objective was to configure the pipeline to identify the ten most relevant chunks of information from the content and ensure efficient query handling.

### **Project 2: Creating a RAG Pipeline and Filter Information**
This challenge involved analyzing data within a fictional context to uncover hidden information and identify the culprit behind a theft. The task emphasized using Haystack's retrieval capabilities to extract meaningful insights from provided datasets.

### **Project 3: Enhancing Retrieval with Multi-Query RAG**
This task focused on creating a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that integrates multi-query retrieval techniques. The goal was to improve recall by retrieving highly relevant answers from external data sources, such as news feeds. Custom components were implemented to enhance the pipeline's performance.
