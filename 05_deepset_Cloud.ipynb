    "Compound AI is a design principle that involves building AI systems as complex, modular systems composed of multiple interacting components. These components can include AI models, retrievers, or external tools, and are designed to work together to tackle AI tasks. This approach allows for flexibility, as components can be evaluated, improved, replaced, or added independently, making the system adaptable to new models or requirements. Compound AI is the dominant paradigm in AI system design today, enabling the creation of sophisticated systems tailored to unique business use cases .\n",
